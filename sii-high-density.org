#+TBLFM: $3=10**$-1;f3
** HST 10 from Tsamis et al 2013MNRAS.430.3406T
+ Distant proplyd - should have peak N_e = 1e5 pcc 
+ R(S II) for proplyd is (1.82 +/- 0.32) / (4.00 +/- 0.67) = 0.455 +/- 0.110
  + log10(R) = -0.34 +/- 0.11
+ Consistent with all 3 high-density limits
+ Background nebula has (2.44 +/- 0.60) / (3.63 +/- 0.88) = 0.67 +/- 0.23
  + log10(R) = -0.17 +/- 0.15 => N = 2000 - 3000 pcc, as expected around there

** LV2 from Tsamis 2011MNRAS.412.1367T
+ Close-in proplyd - should have peak N_e = 2e6 pcc
+ HST FOS DATA
  + For proplyd cusp gives 6731/6716 = 3.73 +/- 1.68 => R = 0.268 +/- 0.121
    + log10(R) = -0.57 +/- 0.19
  + Consistent with PKW09, but not the others
  + For nebula 6731/6716 = 1.75 +/- 0.26 => R = 0.571 +/- 0.085
    + log10(R) = -0.243 +/- 0.065
    + => N = 3000 pcc for PKW09, or higher for other curves
+ VLT ARGUS data
  + Gives inverted ratio as 6731/6716 = 2.64 +/- 0.01 => 6716/6731 = 0.379 +/- 0.001
    + log10(R) = -0.421 +/- 0.002
    + This is lower than any of the theoretical limits!
    + And error bars are suspiciously small.  The relative error on I(6731) is given as 0.04.  It is /possible/ that the error on the ratio is smaller than this, as stated, but a more conservative approach would be to apply this relative error to the ratio also => R = 0.379 +/- 0.016
      + => log10(R) = -0.421 +/- 0.018
    + Consistent with PKW09, but not the others 
  + Background nebula has 6716/31 = 1.66 +/- 0.004 => R = 0.602 +/- 0.001
    + => log10(R) = -0.220 +/- 0.001
    + => N = 3000 - 10,000 pcc depending on which curve


** WFC3 observations of Orion S

[[file:Orion-S-WFC3-Densities.jpg]]

What I wrote to cloudy-dev:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A quick follow-up.   I think the following figure proves beyond doubt that PKW09 is the correct high-density limit (or at least, much closer to reality than Chianti or KKFBL14).

This shows the results from the moth-balled Orion WFC3 paper (I really must get back to finish that ...).  It is the two dimensional histogram of the [S II] and [N II] ratios for every pixel.

The upshot is that almost the entire Orion S field has 6716/6731 ratios that are lower than the KKFBL14 limit (assuming Christophe's figure is correct).  And half of the field has ratios lower than the Chianti limit.
#+END_QUOTE

This seems to rule out R(\infty) > 0.47, given the uncertainties in the observations.


** Getting the data directly from KKFBL14
+ From Table 1, the relevant transitions are N = 3 \to 1 and 2 \to 1
  | N | State  | J   | Wavnum |  \lambda(vac) |        \lambda(air) |
  |---+--------+-----+--------+---------+---------------|
  | 1 | 3p3 4S | 3/2 |      0 | 1 / 0.0 | 1 / 0.0 / 1.0 |
  | 2 | 3p3 2D | 3/2 |  14853 |  6732.6 |        6730.6 |
  | 3 | 3p3 2D | 5/2 |  14885 |  6718.2 |        6716.2 |
  #+TBLFM: $5=1 / $-1 $Ang ; f1::$6=$-1 / 1.000293 ; f1
  + The wavenumbers come from the "Experiment" column
  + The air wavelengths look reasonable
+ Results are given in terms of "transition line strength", S
  + According to Berestetskii, Pitaevskii, & Lifshitz's QED book (Eq. 49.4), the transition probability is proportional to  \omega^3 S / (2 J  + 1)
  + The ratio of \omega^3 is (6731/6716)^3 = 1.007, so that isn't important
  + The ratio of statistical weights is (2 (3/2) + 1) / (2 (3/2)  + 1) = 2/3
    + But this cancels with the factor (2 J + 1) in the expression for N_u
  + So I think we should have I(6716) / I(6731) = 1.007 S_3\to1 / S_2\to1 in high-density limit

  #+TBLFM: $5=1.007 ($3 + $4) / ($1 + $2) ;f3
+ Help, this doesn't make sense!  It should give a ratio smaller than 1

+ Where did Christophe get those numbers from?
+ Looks like columns are lower states, rows are upper states, which means:
  |      A(2 \to 1) |      A(3 \to 1) | I(6716 / 6731) |
  |---------------+---------------+----------------|
  | 5.0317000e-04 | 1.8526000e-04 |          0.552 |
  #+TBLFM: $3=1.5 $2/$1; f3
  + So this is more or less the same as I measured from Christophe's graph above
  + And it is /way/ higher than the earlier consensus value of \approx 0.45

** Other atomic data
+ Wang et al 2004A%26A...427..873W
  + Compare lots of different density-sensitive ratios
  + For [S II] TPs they use:
    + Mendoza & Zeippen (1982) - R = 0.44 in high density limit
    + Keenan et al (1993) 
      - They show a graph (Fig 1) where the high-density limit looks to be 0.46 +/- 0.01, but it seems to be slightly dependent on T - *why is that?*
      - They /say/ that they get values "up to ~ 10% larger" than MZ82, but that is not apparent from the figure.
      - They give a table, which should be more reliable.  Here, I copy the total (E2 + M1) transition probabilities and in the last column give 1.5 times the ratio of A-values, which should be the high-density limit of the intensity ratio:
        |               | A(6716) | A(6731) |  R(\infty) |
        |---------------+---------+---------+-------|
        | "This work"   | 2.85e-4 | 1.24e-3 | 0.345 |
        | MZ82          | 2.60e-4 | 8.82e-4 | 0.442 |
        | "Recommended" | 2.73e-4 | 8.90e-4 | 0.460 |
        #+TBLFM: $4=1.5*$2/$3;f3
      - So, the "recommended" value is consistent with what I measured from the figure
