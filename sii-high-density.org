#+TBLFM: $3=10**$-1;f3
** HST 10 from Tsamis et al 2013MNRAS.430.3406T
+ Distant proplyd - should have peak N_e = 1e5 pcc 
+ R(S II) for proplyd is (1.82 +/- 0.32) / (4.00 +/- 0.67) = 0.455 +/- 0.110
  + log10(R) = -0.34 +/- 0.11
+ Consistent with all 3 high-density limits
+ Background nebula has (2.44 +/- 0.60) / (3.63 +/- 0.88) = 0.67 +/- 0.23
  + log10(R) = -0.17 +/- 0.15 => N = 2000 - 3000 pcc, as expected around there

** LV2 from Tsamis 2011MNRAS.412.1367T
+ Close-in proplyd - should have peak N_e = 2e6 pcc
+ HST FOS DATA
  + For proplyd cusp gives 6731/6716 = 3.73 +/- 1.68 => R = 0.268 +/- 0.121
    + log10(R) = -0.57 +/- 0.19
  + Consistent with PKW09, but not the others
  + For nebula 6731/6716 = 1.75 +/- 0.26 => R = 0.571 +/- 0.085
    + log10(R) = -0.243 +/- 0.065
    + => N = 3000 pcc for PKW09, or higher for other curves
+ VLT ARGUS data
  + Gives inverted ratio as 6731/6716 = 2.64 +/- 0.01 => 6716/6731 = 0.379 +/- 0.001
    + log10(R) = -0.421 +/- 0.002
    + This is lower than any of the theoretical limits!
    + And error bars are suspiciously small.  The relative error on I(6731) is given as 0.04.  It is /possible/ that the error on the ratio is smaller than this, as stated, but a more conservative approach would be to apply this relative error to the ratio also => R = 0.379 +/- 0.016
      + => log10(R) = -0.421 +/- 0.018
    + Consistent with PKW09, but not the others 
  + Background nebula has 6716/31 = 1.66 +/- 0.004 => R = 0.602 +/- 0.001
    + => log10(R) = -0.220 +/- 0.001
    + => N = 3000 - 10,000 pcc depending on which curve
